	<h1>The subject of this lab:</h1>
		<p> The subject of this lab is on file transfer and file structure.
		By putting files in a folder that is specified, we can put them into the
	  website by using css or html. It is important to know the file path and where
	  everything is to be organized. Thats the key, be organized!!d</p>



 	<h1>Difficulties:</h1>
 		<p> Some of the difficulties I enocuntered came from the lab
			was from imporoper syntax. It is important to make sure that evcerything
		  was spelled right and followed the correct path. I also forgot to put
		  semicolons sometimes. </p>



 	<h1>The results:</h1>
 		<p> IN the end, I was able to create my three headers and the three paragraphs.
		Then I was able to add a border with color and change the fonts around. Lastly I created
	  a background for the lab 3 page. The image of the file is below.</p>
