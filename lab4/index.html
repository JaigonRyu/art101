 <h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Probnlem-solving</h1>
	 <p> Jaocb Hanshaw, Yooha Kim
 <h1>Challenges:</h1>
  <p> Learning how to Pseudocode and use problem solving.</p>
 <h1>Problems:</h1>
  <P> We choose the probles of mailing a letter and creating a guessing game with code.</p>
 <h1>Results:</h1>

		Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task-Mailing a Letter:
			1.Choose envelope type and size for your letter.
				  Choose an envelope size that will easily fit your contents.
					Make sure your letter is made out of strong enough material to withstand the trip.
			2.Write the message you would like to send.
			3.Put your message into the envelope and seal.
			4.Address your letter.
					On the envelope in the bottom center write the address of the recipient along with
					their name, city, state, and zip code.
					Then in the top left write your address and your name with your city, state, and
					zip code.
			5.Calculate the postage.
					Find out the destination and weight to properly get the right amount of stamps.
			6.Apply the postage stamps to the top right corner.
			7.Ship your letter to the recipient.
					Either put it in your mailbox and set the mailbox flag up or drop it off in a blue
					collection box. If those are not around take it directly to the post office lobby drop.

		Task 2: Pseudocode a computer task-Guessing game:
			1.Ask the player to input a number range for the computer to choose a random number from
			2.Display input text field where player determines number range
			3.Store the inputted minimum and maximum values into memory as range variables
			4.Choose a random number and store into memory as computer number
			5.Ask the player to make a guess for the stored number
			6.Display input text field asking for the player’s guess
			7.Receive player input and store into memory as player number
			8.Compare the player number with the computer number
			9.Notify player of victory if the numbers are matching. If numbers are not matching,
			 notify player of defeat
			10.Ask and wait for any player input, then start over from step 1 upon input
			11.Clear and reset variables and UI fields when starting over

		Task 3: Turn Pseudocode into comments
			//begin loop
			// Ask the player to input a number range for the computer to choose a random number from
			    // Display input text field where player determines number range
			    // Store the inputted minimum and maximum values into memory as range variables

			    // Choose a random number and store into memory as computer number

			    // Ask the player to make a guess for the stored number
			        // Display input text field asking for the player’s guess

			        // Receive player input and store into memory as player number

			        // Compare the player number with the computer number

			        // Notify player of victory if the numbers are matching. If numbers are not matching,
							notify player of defeat

			        // Ask and wait for any player input, then start over from step 1 upon input
			            // Clear and reset variables and UI fields when starting over
