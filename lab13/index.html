			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>This lab was one of the most challenging we have had so far. We first ran into problems with<br>
				getting the right output for our program. After working it out for a while we got the function<br>
			  up and running. All it took was some configuring with the append statement and else statement to<br>
		  	get it to work. </p>
